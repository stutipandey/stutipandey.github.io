            <p>
                Harvard World Model United Nations (WorldMUN) is the
                world's most internationally diverse college-level
                Model UN conference, and the largest outside of the
                United States and Canada. Every year, 2,000+ currently
                enrolled university students from over 110 countries attend
                WorldMUN in a different location around the world.
                Past locations include Singapore, Puebla (Mexico),
                Geneva (Switzerland),Beijing (China), Belo Horizonte (Brazil),
                Sharm el-Sheikh (Egypt),Taipei (Taiwan), The Hague (Netherlands),
                and Panama City (Panama). Through lively and informed debate, exciting social events, and a
                unique conference spirit, the WorldMUN experience reaches across
                cultures and borders to inspire both cooperation and friendship.

            <h1 class="heading">SUBSTANTIVE EXCELLENCE</h1>
            <p>
                WorldMUN hosts twenty simulated committees from the United Nations,
                featuring a multitude of member states, international organizations,
                and related governmental and non-governmental bodies. Our committee
                sessions are directed by an extremely involved dais staff, providing
                the perfect setting for participants to discuss some of the most
                pressing problems of our generation.
            </p>

         <h1 class="heading">CULTURAL CONNECTION</h1>
            <p>
                The conference blends together engaging committee sessions with
                immersive in-conference trips and spectacular social events to
                provide an unforgettable experience. This goal is embodied by the
                ‘WorldMUN Spirit’ - a guiding principle that encourages friendship
                and cooperation across borders, along with a deeper understanding of
                cultures and perspectives beyond one’s own.

             <h1 class="heading">DELEGATE EXPERIENCE</h1>
                <p>
                    The true essence of WorldMUN revolves around the delegate experience,
                    and we are committed to ensuring that our participants have the most
                    engaging and enriching experience possible. Whether this comes from
                    debate or diplomacy inside committee or the formation of relationships
                    with fellow WorldMUNers from around the globe, the conference is an
                    experience that delegates remember for a lifetime.
